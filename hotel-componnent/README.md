Project Overview
App.js
The App.js file serves as the main container that sets up routing for the different sections of the hotel management system. It renders a navigation bar (Navbar) and a dynamic content area that changes based on the selected tab.

#### Navbar Component

The Navbar component contains the top navigation bar with clickable tabs for each hotel category. When a user clicks on a tab, the page switches to show content related to that category (overview, restaurant, etc.).

#### Hotel Tabs

The HotelTabs component renders content based on the selected tab. Each tab corresponds to a different category and displays relevant information.

#### Future Improvement

Authentication: Add user authentication and authorization for hotel managers.
Backend Integration: Connect the frontend to a backend API to fetch dynamic data such as hotel details, restaurant menu, and user reviews.
Interactive UI: Improve the user interface with interactive features like forms for submitting orders, reviews, etc.
Search and Filter: Implement search and filter options for meal and review categories.
